    L0Smooth(; λ=2e-2, κ=2.0, βmax=1e5)

    smooth(img, f::L0Smooth)
    smooth!(out, img, f::L0Smooth)

Smoothing `img` via L0 gradient minimization to approximate prominent structure
in a sparsity-control manner.

# Output

Return the smoothed image as an `Array{Float64}` of `size(channelview(img))`.

# Details

Using the strategy of minimizing the L0 norm of image's gradient.

This algorithm works particularly effective for sharpening major edges by 
increasing the steepness of amplitude transition while eliminating 
low-amplitude structures to some extent. See [1] for more details. 

# Options

The function argument is described in detail below.

## `λ::Float64`

The argument `𝜆` is a weight directly controlling the significance of 
the L0 gradient norm term, which must be greater than zero.

A larger `𝜆` makes the smoothed image have very few edges.

Default: 2e-2

## `βmax::Float64`

The argument `βmax` is the upper bound of `𝛽` in [1], which must be greater than 1e4.

In this algorithm, two auxiliary variables `ℎ` and `𝑣` are used to approximate 
the solution. A large enough `𝛽` ensures that the alternating optimization strategy 
based on introducing auxiliary variables is available.

Default: 1e5

## `κ::Float64`

The argument `𝜅` is the iteraiton rate, which must be larger than 1.0.

This algorithm using an alternating optimization strategy to get the solution.
In each iteration, the argument `𝛽` controls the similarity between gradient pair 
`(𝛥₁𝑆ₚ, 𝛥₂𝑆ₚ)` (denoted by `($ \partial_x S_p $, \partial_y S_p)`) and auxiliary pair `(ℎₚ, 𝑣ₚ)`.
The argument `𝜅` is used to update `𝛽` as `𝛽 ⟵ 𝜅𝛽`.

Default: 2.0

# Examples

```julia
using TestImages
using ImageSmooth

img = testimage("cameraman")
fₛ = L0Smooth() # using default arguements
imgₛ = smooth(img, fₛ)

fₛ = L0Smooth(λ=0.0015, κ=1.05, βmax=2e5) # manually set the arguments
imgₛ = smooth(img, fₛ)
```
