See [1] for more details. \n\nOptions\n\nThe function argument is described in detail below.\n\nλ::Float64\n\nThe argument 𝜆 is a weight directly controlling the significance of  the L0 gradient norm term, which must be greater than zero.\n\nA larger 𝜆 makes the smoothed image have very few edges.\n\nDefault: 2e-2\n\nβmax::Float64\n\nThe argument βmax is the upper bound of 𝛽 in [1], which must be greater than 1e4.\n\nIn this algorithm, two auxiliary variables ℎ and 𝑣 are used to approximate  the solution. A large enough 𝛽 ensures that the alternating optimization strategy  based on introducing auxiliary variables is available.\n\nDefault: 1e5\n\nκ::Float64\n\nThe argument 𝜅 is the iteraiton rate, which must be larger than 1.0.\n\nThis algorithm using an alternating optimization strategy to get the solution. In each iteration, the argument 𝛽 controls the similarity between gradient pair  (𝛥₁𝑆ₚ, 𝛥₂𝑆ₚ) (denoted by (partial_x S_p partial_y S_p) in [1]) and auxiliary pair (ℎₚ, 𝑣ₚ). The argument 𝜅 is used to update 𝛽 as 𝛽 ⟵ 𝜅𝛽.\n\nDefault: 2.0\n\nExamples\n\nYou can use the default arguments for L0Smooth, and then use smooth to apply  the AbstractImageSmoothAlgorithm.\n\nusing TestImages\nusing ImageSmooth\n\nimg = testimage(\"cameraman\")\n\nfₛ = L0Smooth() # using default arguements\nimgₛ = smooth(img, fₛ)\n\nManually setting the arguements is also available:\n\nfₛ = L0Smooth(λ=0.0015, κ=1.05, βmax=2e5) # manually set the arguments\nimgₛ = smooth(img, fₛ)\n\nSee also smooth! for in-place operation.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Xu, L., Lu, C., Xu, Y., & Jia, J.
